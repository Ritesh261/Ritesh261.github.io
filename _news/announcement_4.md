Joined Devfi Inc, as a Data scientist.

In the midst of a transformative summer internship, I found myself at the forefront of an exciting projectâ€”a revolutionary Copy Editing Tool designed for publishing houses. The mission at hand was clear: to streamline the often arduous task of manuscript refinement, making it not just efficient but also precise.

Armed with my role as a Data Scientist, we embarked on a journey to infuse the power of AI into the heart of document editing. My focus was on training and fine-tuning advanced models, delving into the intricacies of Big Bird, Longformer, and BERT. to create a classifier capable of categorizing transcripts based on the complexity of editing required.

Our journey unfolded with the implementation of Distributed Data Parallel and Full Shared Data Parallel techniques. The results were striking, with the once daunting 40-hour training time for the Longformer model reduced to a mere 9 hours.

The use case was far-reaching. Our solution went beyond mere categorization; we developed a comprehensive tool that incorporated a BERT-based punctuation model, a Spacy contextual spell checker, and a grammatical error pipeline. The inbuilt document editor became a vigilant companion, flagging errors ranging from spelling and punctuation to nuanced language dialects. The end result? A refined manuscript, poised and ready for publication.
