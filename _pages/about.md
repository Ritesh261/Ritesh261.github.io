I am a passionate computer science master's student at the University at Buffalo, deeply engaged in cutting-edge technologies such as Machine Learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). My academic journey has led me through an exploration of Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, and Blockchain, where I've delved into a diverse range of languages and technologies, including GO, RUST, C, C++, Python, Solidity, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Node.js.

As a Data Scientist, I've applied my skills to develop AI SaaS products, with a focus on object recognition, face detection, OCR, and more. My journey includes a transformative internship at Devfi, where I led the development of a Copy Editing Tool for publication houses. Leveraging Bert-based models, distributed data parallel techniques, and language tool integrations, I achieved a 91% accuracy in classifying and analyzing transcripts for editing.

My undergraduate journey in electronics and communication engineering fueled my early interest in signal processing and machine learning, culminating in a groundbreaking project on optimizing multi-user beamforming using Beamformer neural networks.

I am driven by a passion for pushing the boundaries of innovation, creating meaningful projects, and contributing to the transformative landscapes of blockchain and AI. Looking ahead, I am excited to continue this journey, eager to explore new horizons and collaborate on impactful projects that shape the future of technology.
